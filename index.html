        <b>A Think Tank for the Digital Era
        </b>
        <br>
        <p>The digital economy, driven largely by data and other intangibles, demands a new approach to international governance across the areas of trade, law, security, economic policy and privacy, to name a few.</p>
        
        <p>Policy making is shifting dramatically as governments strive to keep up with new technologies and manage the increasing volume of data flowing across borders. Institutions — national, regional and international — must evolve quickly to fill governance and regulatory gaps exactly at a time when support for international cooperation is lacking.
        </p>
        <br>
        <b>The Economy Is Driven by Data</b>
        <p>The policy and legal architecture needed to effectively govern data, artificial intelligence and platforms is not keeping pace with privacy, competition and consumer protection concerns. Trade policy, financial systems and international standards must be addressed.</p>
        <br>
        <b>New Technologies Threaten Democracy and Security</b>
        <br>
        <p>The international security and geopolitical landscape has changed fundamentally, a shift driven in many ways by new technologies and the lack of internationally accepted rules around their use. Innovation, intellectual property, cybersecurity, internet and digital platform governance, and online violence issues are at the core of this work.</p>
        <b>Global Institutions Must Adapt to the Digital Era</b>
        <p>Multilateral institutions must be renewed — or, in some cases, created — to counter the isolationism, dysfunction and stalemate that have hampered responses to some of the world’s biggest challenges. The Group of Twenty and the Group of Seven, the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund are among the key institutions under scrutiny.</p>

        <h1>PRE-ELECTION AWARENESS PROGRAM</h1>
        <br>
  
        <b>Tool summary</b>
        <br>
        <p>A Pre-Election Voter Awareness Campaign (PEVAC) is aimed at sensitizing
          voters about the importance of participating in the electoral process as a way to
          ensure a responsive, accountable and democratically elected government. In a
          democracy, a free and fair vote is the fundamental tool through which citizens
          can express their political preferences and developmental wishes. However, in
          representative forms of democracies, merely casting the vote may not be
          adequate to hold the elected officials and the executive accountable or to foster a
          responsive and transparent government. Therefore, providing voters with
          information on the electoral process, political parties and their manifestos, poll
          antecedents of the candidates etc. are necessary to educate them prior to the
          polling day is critical to enable them cast an enlightened and informed vote. A
          PEVAC aims to precisely do that i.e. to provide such critical information and in
          doing so, create better-informed, more motivated citizenry and, ultimately, a more
          responsive, transparent and accountable government.</p>
          <br>
          <b>What's it</b>
          <br>
          <p>A Pre-Election Voter Awareness Campaign is aimed at making people aware of:
            the importance of their participation in the electoral processes either as voters or
            candidates; the modes of participation; the procedure to become eligible for
            voting and to actually cast their vote; the ways to assess the poll-worthiness of a
            candidate. The goal of a Pre-Election Voter Awareness Campaign is to create an
            environment for free and fair elections, and to encourage in particular, the
            participation of marginalized groups such as women, the minorities, special
            ethnic communities and the poor..
            Such a campaign was pioneered in five states in India in 2006 by the Society for
            Participatory Research in Asia and its partners. It was hailed as a success owing
            to reports of a substantial increase in the overall participation of voters, and
            women and members of the lower castes, in particular. Similar awareness
            campaigns have been undertaken in other countries such as for e.g. the Republic
            of Georgia, a fledgling democracies such as the Republic of Georgia, where the
            main focus was on increasing citizens‟ understanding of electoral standards and 
            procedures, and on promoting active participation of voters.

        <h1>Why experts opinions is important!!</h1>
        <hr>
        <b>Expert opinion is often sought by government regulatory agencies when there is insufficient empirical evidence to judge the safety implications of a course of action. However, it can be reckless to continue following expert opinion when a preponderance of evidence is amassed that conflicts with this opinion.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Nearly every dental malpractice claim requires expert testimony.  Experts help determine the requisite standard of care, whether or not that standard was met, and, if so, if a deviation caused the injury complained of by the plaintiff.  Expert deposition and trial testimony are critical.
        </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>An expert who practices in a certain area, relevant to the issues formulating the allegations in a lawsuit, will be more persuasive.  An expert who does not have a high level of competency will be exposed on the deposition, at trial, and maybe excluded from testifying at all.  Many times dental cases are won or lost based on the effectiveness of expert testimony.  Having a qualified expert, who knows the medicine and understands the assertions in a complaint, can be the difference between a successful and unsuccessful result.  Therefore, wisely choose experts.
        </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Experts may provide the court with the specialist knowledge necessary to assess the health condition of a person applying for a disability benefit, for example, including the type of existing health problems, their degree of advancement and the severity of the related ailments, collectively determining the ability or lack of ability to perform employment. Case law emphasises that in this regard the court may not rely on its own conviction, principles of logical thinking, life experience and common knowledge. This is because these criteria, for obvious reasons, do not include specialist medical knowledge.

    <h1>Advantage of Media For Election</h1>
    <hr>
    <b>Media and Election</b>
    <br>
    <p>The media are essential to democracy, and a democratic election is impossible without media. A free and fair election is not only about the freedom to vote and the knowledge of how to cast a vote, but also about a participatory process where voters engage in public debate and have adequate information about parties, policies, candidates and the election process itself in order to make informed choices. Furthermore, media acts as a crucial watchdog to democratic elections, safeguarding the transparency of the process. Indeed, a democratic election with no media freedom, or stifled media freedom, would be a contradiction.
    </p>
    
    <p>In order to fulfill their roles, the media need to maintain a high level of professionalism, accuracy and impartiality in their coverage.  Regulatory frameworks can help ensure high standards. Laws and regulation should guarantee fundamental freedoms essential to democracy, including freedom of information and expression, as well as participation. Meanwhile, provisions such as requiring government media, funded out of public money, to give fair coverage and equitable access to opposition parties, help ensure appropriate media behavior during elections.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <b>Role of the media play in election</b>
    <br>
    <p>The media play an indispensable role in the proper functioning of a democracy.  Discussion of the media's functions within electoral contexts, often focuses on their "watchdog" role: by unfettered scrutiny and discussion of the successes and failures of candidates, governments, and electoral management bodies, the media can inform the public of how effectively they have performed and help to hold them to account. Yet the media also have other roles in enabling full public participation in elections:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <ol>
        <li>by educating voters on how to exercise their democratic rights;
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>by providing a platform for the political parties and candidates to communicate their message to the electorate;
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>by providing a platform for the public to communicate their concerns, opinions, and needs, to the parties/candidates, the EMB, the government, and to other voters, and to interact on these issues;
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>by allowing the parties and candidates to debate with each other;
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>by reporting results and monitoring vote counting;
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>by scrutinizing the electoral process itself, including electoral management, in order to evaluate the fairness of the process, its efficiency, and its probity;
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>by providing information that, as far as possible, avoids inflammatory language, helping to prevent election-related violence.
        </li>
        <br>
      </ol>
